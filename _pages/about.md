I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University, advised by [Prof. Seon Joo Kim](https://sites.google.com/site/seonjookim/). 
Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received a B.S. degree from Yonsei University.

My research focuses on **Robot Learning** ü§ñ and **Video Understanding** üé•	.
I am particularly interested in leveraging <i>in-the-wild</i> human videos to teach robots everyday tasks, starting from simple actions such as pick-and-place and progressing toward more complex behaviors.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com) at NYU to address core challenges in using human videos for robot learning.
I also actively collaborate with [Prof. Youngwoon Lee](https://youngwoon.github.io) on learning from video in robotics.
